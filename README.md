Learning Machine Learning Concepts using Python and SciPy

The purpose of this Repository is to help me get a better understanding of how to use Machine Learning tools and libraries as well as concepts and algorithms.

The following program has been created using the following link/tutorial:
https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
--
Part of this tutortial was also used:
https://pythonprogramming.net/linear-svc-example-scikit-learn-svm-python/

The algorithms used in this program are:
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each Algorithm is compared with eachother to determine which has the highest accuracy.
Comparison is done simply by accuracy
