Learning Machine Learning Concepts using Python and SciPy

The purpose of this Repository is to help me get a better understanding of how to use Machine Learning tools and libraries as well as concepts and algorithms.

The following program has been created using the following link/tutorial. 

https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/

The algorithms used in this program are:
* Logistic Regression (LR)
* Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
* Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
